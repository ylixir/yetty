/******* yetty - a getty replacement ********
 *
 * this program is meant to be something in between a getty and a dm
 * it runs on a virtual console just like a getty, but is interactive
 * much like a dm. it will allow logging straight into x, but without
 * the overhead or instability of a full dm. it will also allow choosing
 * shells or desktop environments to log into, unlike a tty.
 *
 * it is meant to be run from a virtual console, and for now, it would
 * be inappropriate to try to run this over a serial link or network.
 *
 * it should also serve as a learning tool. so if you want to see how
 * i figured out the black magic, take a look at the references.
